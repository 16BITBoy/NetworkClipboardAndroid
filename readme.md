Network Clipboard for Android
=============================
This program allows you to share your clipboard text from your PC to your smartphone, 
when both are connected to your home LAN. Currently, there is no encryption in it, 
so don't use it to send sensitive information. For that reason, sharing of the
clipboard has to be requested explicitly by selecting "Send clipboard" in the system
tray icon contextual menu.

The service this application installs has to be started manually by going to the 
Network Clipboard Service Control application. Also, remember to disable it when you
are not using it.

Project is still very alpha, so use it at your own risk.

Please, checkout the Windows client to make it work.
